Most Dangerous Animal in Each U.S. State (2025)
Interactive Web Map by Lulu Brannan — GHY 4818 Web Mapping

This project is an interactive, data-driven web map that visualizes the most dangerous animal in each U.S. state. The map transforms publicly accessible wildlife-risk summaries into a clean, and engaging digital product. It is inspired by the 2025 article:

“The 50 Most Dangerous Animals in Each US-State Revealed” — Animals Around the Globe (2025)

Project Purpose & Concept:

The primary goal of this map is to take an article formatted for general audiences and translate its content into a functional, interactive web experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Leaflet.js mapping library. Instead of presenting the information as a static list, this map allows users to spatially explore patterns and compare risk levels across regions. Each state is styled by the animal’s danger category, and clicking reveals a popup containing the associated species and risk description.

The project emphasizes user-centered design, prioritizing clarity, accessibility, and ease of navigation. Color-coded categories, hover highlighting, and dynamic popups make the information approachable even for users without any GIS experience.

Features:

Color-coded state polygons representing animal danger categories

Mouseover highlighting to support map navigation

Popups displaying the animal, reason for danger, and category

Filter buttons to quickly isolate categories (mammals, insects, marine, etc.)

Fully responsive layout that works across browsers and screen sizes

Learning Outcomes:

This project demonstrates applied skills in web mapping, JavaScript logic, spatial data handling, and UI/UX design. It represents the culmination of core GHY 4818 concepts: data transformation, Map-to-Web workflows, and interactive cartography.
