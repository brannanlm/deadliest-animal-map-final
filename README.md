Most Dangerous Animal in Each U.S. State (2025)
Interactive Web Map by Lulu Brannan — GHY 4818 Web Mapping

This project is an interactive web map that visualizes the most dangerous animal in each U.S. state, based on publicly accessible wildlife-risk summaries and interpretations inspired by the 2025 article:

“The 50 Most Dangerous Animals in Each US-State Revealed” — Animals Around the Globe (2025)
https://www.animalsaroundtheglobe.com/the-50-most-dangerous-animals-in-each-us-state-8-201489/

The goal of this map is to take a news-style article and transform its information into a functional, user-friendly web map using Leaflet.js. The final product allows users to explore dangerous-animal threats across the U.S. and interact with state-level data.
